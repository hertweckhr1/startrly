**Code Requirements** |
Only limited changes to the HTML (classes added for selection) |
Page normalized | Check!
CSS grid used for layout | Check - next time work to create 2 dimensional grid too!
Flexbox used for layout | Yes yes - well done, especailly with new addition on meet the team section!
Google font used | Check - cool way of doing it via html 
CSS pseudo selector used | Check - great way of using before to input gray line break
Background color | Default white - feel free to explore once you have the wireframe set in the future. 
DRY CSS code | Nice work - think about deleting items that are no longer doing anything to code. (e.g. inline flex in team img)
Appearance matches the image | Yes! Looks so good!
**Overall** |
Overall - super great job!  It looks really really nice and matches really well with the wireframe. Three cheers for first project on CSS and HTML. It also works really well when screen is small(mobile) or big.
